# C++ code for Bayesian evidence approximation 

This takes as input the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo posterior samples from the [Planck Legacy Archive](http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/) which were obtained using [CosmoMC](https://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/) (a Fortran Metropolis-Hastings algorithm used prolifically in Cosmology) and outputs approximate [Bayesian evidence ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor) and maximum likelihood estimates using multivariate kernel density estimation over 3 core observational features of the [Cosmic Microwave Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background): the scalar power spectrum amplitude, the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio while also including the degree of Non-Gaussianity added assuming statistical independence. There is a version of this code with linear boundary bias corrections included, however the result was not found to be significantly affected. The code takes its model priors from [a class of multi-field cosmic inflation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvaton) and compares them to predictions of some single-field mononomial potentials. If (by any chance) you want to use this code, please cite [Hardwick & Byrnes (2015)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2015/08/010).
